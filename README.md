# Sample Angular App

This is an App to be run in the Zowe UI, which helps demonstrate how to build an App using Angular which can make use of the framework objects and features present in both Angular and ZLUX, the underlying technology of the Zowe UI.

You can compare and contrast this to two other sample Apps:
React: https://github.com/zowe/sample-react-app
IFrame: https://github.com/zowe/sample-iframe-app

**To request features or report bugs, please use the issues page at the [zlux repo](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues) with the sample-app or app tags**
